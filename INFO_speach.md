If you’re looking for **real-time, open-source, conversational Text‑to‑Speech (TTS) and Speech‑to‑Text (STT)** systems that can work together in streaming or telephony environments, here are some of the most promising options:

---

## Real-Time Open-Source Speech-to-Text (STT) Options

* **Whisper (OpenAI)**:
  A transformer-based open-source STT model with strong accuracy and multi-language support. It’s widely used in real-time transcription pipelines.([Reddit][1])

* **RealtimeSTT**:
  Designed explicitly for low-latency speech-to-text. Includes voice activity detection and near-instant transcription—ideal for live conversational agents.([GitHub][2])

* **DeepSpeech**:
  Mozilla’s open-source, real-time STT engine optimized for a broad range of hardware (even Raspberry Pi). It’s easy to customize and train your own models.([AssemblyAI][3])

* **Kaldi**:
  A flexible, research-grade speech recognition toolkit often used under the hood for building high-performance streaming ASR systems.([Wikipedia][4])

---

## Real-Time Open-Source Text-to-Speech (TTS) Options

* **RealtimeTTS**:
  Built for minimal-latency TTS streaming. Excellent for generating audio on-the-fly in conversational systems.([GitHub][5])

* **Festival / Flite**:
  Classic open-source TTS engines. Festival is full-featured and customizable; Flite (Festival Lite) is lightweight and suitable for embedded environments.([Wikipedia][6])

* **eSpeakNG**:
  Compact, multi-language TTS synthesizer. Fast and lightweight—not as natural sounding, but practical for low-resource or embedded use.([Wikipedia][7])

---

## Conversational AI Toolkits (Speech Processing + TTS/STT)

* **SpeechBrain**:
  A PyTorch-based toolkit for speech tasks: STT, TTS, speaker ID, enhancement, plus LLM integration. Great if you want to build end-to-end conversational pipelines.([arXiv][8])

* **PaddleSpeech**:
  A flexible all-in-one speech toolkit with both STT and TTS components. Offers pretrained models and scripting for real-time use.([arXiv][9])

---

## Cutting-Edge Streaming Framework

* **Moshi (full-duplex speech-to-speech)**:
  A real-time dialogue model that turns spoken input directly into spoken responses (bypassing text). Supports overlapping speech and handles conversational nuance with low latency (\~160ms).([arXiv][10])

## Recommended Combinations for Real-Time Conversational Agents

| Use Case                          | STT Option                  | TTS Option                  | Notes                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Lightweight real-time voice agent | RealtimeSTT                 | RealtimeTTS                 | Ultra-low latency, ideal for streaming.               |
| Flexible dev setup                | Whisper + Festival          | Festival                    | Good balance of quality and simplicity.               |
| Full pipeline (research-style)    | SpeechBrain or PaddleSpeech | SpeechBrain or PaddleSpeech | One toolkit for building full conversational flow.    |
| Advanced direct speech dialogue   | Moshi (all-in-one)          | —                           | Real-time speech-to-speech, minimal latency overhead. |

### Community Perspective (Reddit)

One user aggregated a helpful list of popular open-source projects:

> “Faster Whisper, Insanely fast Whisper, Distil‑Whisper… Coqui AI's TTS and STT models… Tortoise‑TTS, StyleTTS2, SenseVoice (STT), CosyVoice (TTS)… Kokoro TTS, Zonos, Metavoice, F5‑TTS, Orpheus‑TTS, MegaTTS3, Index‑tts, Dia TTS, Spark‑TTS…"([GitHub][2], [Reddit][1], [arXiv][9], [arXiv][8])

This list shows how many emerging options are available depending on your latency, quality, and licensing needs.

### Summary Recommendation

If you want a **simultaneous real-time conversational TTS + STT pipeline**, the **RealtimeSTT + RealtimeTTS** pairing is your most straightforward open-source starting point.

For more advanced or custom workflows—like streaming agents, call integrations, or rich conversational logic—**SpeechBrain** or **PaddleSpeech** provide full-stack toolkits that simplify development.

And if you want to avoid text entirely and go straight from voice input to voice output conversationally, try experimenting with **Moshi**—a state-of-the-art full-duplex framework in development.

Let me know if you'd like help setting up any of these stacks or evaluating performance across models!
